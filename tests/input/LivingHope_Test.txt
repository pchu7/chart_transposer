Verse 1                                            	B+P
                         A                     Esus
How great the chasm that lay be-tween us
                      D           F#m                     E
How high the mountain       I could not climb
                  A                      E
In desper-ation, I turned to heaven
                          D          Esus        A
and spoke Your name in - to      the night
                             D                               A
Then through the darkness Your loving-kindness
                           F#m7                E 
tore through the shadows of my soul
                     A                          Esus
The work is finished, the end is written
           D            Esus    A      
Jesus Christ, my living hope
